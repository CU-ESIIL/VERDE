# VERDE

Welcome to the **Vast Exploration and Research in Dry Forest Ecosystems (VERDE)** repository, an integral part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository is the central hub for our working group, encompassing our project overview, proposals, team member information, codebase, and more.

## Our Project
We aim to harness environmental data science to understand the evolutionary past, contemporary biogeography, and probable futures of a globally distributed and threatened biome—tropical dry forests. Specifically, we will examine the distribution of deciduousness across evolutionary time, across geographical gradients, and to forecast the success of the deciduous trait under future climates by bringing together datasets spanning phylogenetic trees, functional traits, field-based phenology data, remote sensing imagery, and ecosystem modeling. Importantly, our working group will broaden the century-old and geographically biased ‘temperate phenology paradigm’ by identifying past, present, and future determinants of tropical phenological variation.
